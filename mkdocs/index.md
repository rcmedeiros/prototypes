# @rcmedeiros/prototypes

Yet another general purpose JavaScript prototypes library

## Install

`npm install --save @rcmedeiros/prototypes`

## Usage

Just import it in the first module your package loads, maybe index.js/ts. No need to keep reference.

TypeScript typings are included.

```typescript
import '@rcmedeiros/prototypes';
```

!!! note
    The module comes with its [Declaration File](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html), meaning it can be imported seamlessly to a TypeScript project.
